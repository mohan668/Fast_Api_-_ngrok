 FastAPI with ngrok - Expose Your API to the Internet

This is a simple guide to help you expose your FastAPI application to the internet using ngrok. This allows you to access your FastAPI app from anywhere in the world.

 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. ngrok: You will need ngrok to expose your local FastAPI server to the internet. Download ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download).
3. FastAPI: FastAPI and the required libraries will be installed in a virtual environment.

 Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
    - Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt).
    - Navigate to your project directory (where `main.py` will reside).
    - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
    - To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
      - For PowerShell:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```
      - For Command Prompt:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of the command line, indicating the virtual environment is activated.

---

 Step 2: Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the necessary libraries:

1. Install FastAPI:
    - Run the following command to install FastAPI:
      ```bash
      pip install fastapi
      ```

2. Install Uvicorn:
    - Uvicorn is the ASGI server that FastAPI uses. Install it with:
      ```bash
      pip install uvicorn
      ```

 Step 3: Set Up ngrok

Follow these steps to set up ngrok:

 1. Download ngrok

- Go to the [ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the executable for your operating system.
- Place `ngrok.exe` in a folder, for example, `C:\My_Downloads\ngrok`.

 2. Get ngrok Authtoken

- Sign up for a free account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
- Once logged in, navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to find your authtoken.

 3. Configure ngrok with your authtoken

- Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run the following command to add your authtoken:
    ```bash
    & "C:\My_Downloads\ngrok\ngrok.exe" config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
    ```
- Replace `YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with the token you obtained from your ngrok dashboard.

 Step 4: Run FastAPI Application

Once ngrok is configured, follow these steps to run your FastAPI application:

 1. Create `main.py`

Create a `main.py` file in your project directory with the FastAPI application logic. This file will handle your API's endpoints and responses.

 2. Run FastAPI App

- Open a terminal window (make sure the virtual environment is activated), navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and run the following command to start the FastAPI app:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
- This will start your FastAPI application, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

 Step 5: Expose FastAPI with ngrok

Now, let's expose your FastAPI application to the internet:

 1. Open a new terminal

- Open a second terminal window (keeping the FastAPI app running in the first terminal).

 2. Start ngrok

- In the second terminal, run the following command to create a secure tunnel to your FastAPI app running on port `8000`:
    ```bash
    & "C:\My_Downloads\ngrok\ngrok.exe" http 8000
    ```

 3. Check ngrok Output

- After running the command, you should see output similar to this:
    ```
    Forwarding                    https://5e14-2409-40f2-311e-8275-7dc2-4da7-f002-593b.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000
    ```
- The URL `https://5e14-2409-40f2-311e-8275-7dc2-4da7-f002-593b.ngrok-free.app` is your public API endpoint that can be accessed from anywhere.

 Step 6: Access and Test Your API

1. Access FastAPI Documentation:
    - You can access the FastAPI interactive API documentation at the following URL:
    ```
    https://5e14-2409-40f2-311e-8275-7dc2-4da7-f002-593b.ngrok-free.app/docs
    ```

2. Send a POST Request:
    - To test your API, you can send a POST request to the `/command` endpoint (or any other endpoint you defined).
    - Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to send a request.

 Optional: Automate with a `.bat` File (Windows)

To automate starting both the FastAPI app and ngrok tunnel, you can create a `.bat` file:

 1. Create `start_server.bat`

Create a `.bat` file with the following contents to start both FastAPI and ngrok:

```batch
@echo off
echo Starting FastAPI...
start python main.py
timeout /t 5 /nobreak
echo Starting ngrok...
start "C:\My_Downloads\ngrok\ngrok.exe" http 8000
pause
